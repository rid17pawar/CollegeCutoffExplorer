# CollegeCutoffExplorer

## Introduction
This project is developed exclusively for students aspiring to study in Top Engineering Colleges in Maharashtra. Instead of reading through all of the cut-off lists, students will be able to find a particular college and branch cut-off using this system. This facilitates in filtering the search results based on college name, branch name, and percentile to obtain accurate information in a blink of an eye. </br></br>
The admission process for engineering colleges is a crucial phase for students as it determines their future academic and professional pursuits. It is not just about securing a seat in a college but also about making the right choice for their career. Some factors like Multiple Entrance Exams, Complex Application Process, Limited Seats, Time Constraints can make the admission process stressful and tedious for students. However, with proper planning and preparation, students can navigate the process more effectively and reduce their stress levels. </br></br>
Our projectâ€™s primary purpose is to provide consolidated information about all engineering colleges along with the caste-wise cut-off list for all available branches. Currently, our project is developed specifically for students aspiring to get admitted in Top Engineering Colleges in Maharashtra. This will help students to search for a particular college and branch cut-off instead of going through the whole cut-off lists. This helps to narrow-down the search based on college name, branch name, percentile in order to get the precise information in a fraction of seconds.
